# Documentation Index

This directory contains conceptual design artifacts for the IL interpreter and dump-time evaluation project.

## Current delivery focus

The only active product target is a deterministic, read-only expression evaluator grounded in a .NET dump. The W0 repository/toolchain reset and W1–W2 generated-dump vertical slice are implemented in-tree: exact/partial evidence; fully dump-sourced tiny and compiler-emitted fat method bodies; a closed root-field query grammar; typed snapshot-scoped root bindings; immutable plans that select their field once; exact-null and compatible coalescing over `String` and `Nullable<Int32>` alongside direct `Int32`; canonical request/root-selection/plan identities; explicit snapshot/module identity availability, evidence source, fallback, and path-accurate actually-applied bounds; honest no-answer completeness with retained explanatory evidence; and a concrete differential kernel are executable proofs. The versioned W2 corpus contains 22 cases spanning 20 distinct expression texts and reproduces the complete canonical result byte sequence/SHA-256 for all cases plus the canonical plan projection string/SHA-256 for the 13 cases whose preparation succeeds, both within one session and after a fresh open and rebind. W2 is complete for its non-cybersecurity scope: [GitHub Actions run 29364905178](https://github.com/VladimirReshetnikov/Interpreter/actions/runs/29364905178) passed all four required jobs at exact closure commit `5bed47100`. A whole-file-identified disk PE remains only an independent oracle.

W1 is complete for its revised non-security dump-evidence scope: real reads; typed exact/partial/unavailable/conflict outcomes; honest answer completeness; stable identity/context/provenance; path-accurate bounds; fresh-session canonical replay; repository-wide headless execution; truthful topology; and exact-HEAD hosted CI. [GitHub Actions run 29353198889](https://github.com/VladimirReshetnikov/Interpreter/actions/runs/29353198889) passed all four required jobs at exact closure commit `e2580a8a8`.

A versioned malformed-minidump mutation corpus and a Windows x64 one-shot external-worker prototype are retained as
separately landed, non-gating work outside W1 and W2. The worker's malformed-artifact checkpoint passed locally. Their
five hostile-corpus facts and the ExternalWorker test project provide no milestone validation: all current W1/W2 test
invocations exclude `Scope=Cybersecurity`. Restore/build intentionally remains repository-wide across all 15 projects,
including the worker projects and IntegrationTests assembly, as topology/compilation-health evidence only—not
cybersecurity behavioral evidence. Their presence does not admit arbitrary external artifacts.

The versioned optimized Release modeled-incident report is W1 generated-context evidence and records raw member bytes at 5/5, attributable context at 1/5, and product-query availability at 1/5 while retaining all unavailable cases. It explicitly describes one generated modeled dump, not a representative private-production incident corpus, and therefore establishes no production recoverability rate; representative production measurement is not a W1 gate. Current in-process resource admission still limits dumps to 8 GiB, ClrMD's dump cache to 256 MiB with stack-derived caches disabled, and managed PEs to 512 MiB on the actually opened stream before hashing. Virtual stepping, whole-method abstract analysis, async/dynamic lifting, multi-application hosting, and other platform extensions are research backlog until their entry gates pass.

Current, active, and supporting documents use two dimensions: lifecycle (`Draft`, `Current`, `Complete`, `Historical`, `Superseded`) and roadmap relation (`Active`, `Supporting`, `Research`, `Reference`, `Historical`). Historical source/library records may use one combined status when a second axis would add no decision value. A designed or documented capability is not thereby implemented or validated. `Historical` and `Superseded` documents are preserved for rationale and source research; they are not instructions to recreate their proposed topology or backend choice.

These sketches explain earlier reasoning, but neither their API shapes nor their project-per-seam package map is normative. Start from the current prototype source and `proposals/architecture/prototype-solution-structure-proposal.md` instead.

4. `proposals/integration/pe-pdb-reader-integration-proposal.md`
5. `lib/backend-evidence-log.md`

Generic-context reconstruction and call/effect modeling are later research topics, not prerequisites for the active W1–W2 evidence path.

### Process and governance path

1. `governance/project-faq.md`

- Prefer stable filenames; if renaming, update links in both root `README.md` and this index.

## Documentation WIP policy

For current-state questions, prefer evidence in this order: executable tests and their recorded results, prototype source/solution, active decision records and plans, then supporting proposals. Historical/research documents explain possibilities and prior reasoning; they do not override those sources.

Do not add a new subsystem proposal merely because an existing plan mentions one. Add or deepen design only when the active vertical slice needs the contract, and pair the change with an executable validation step whenever practical. When evidence changes, update the active snapshot/traceability entry and mark superseded guidance explicitly instead of silently leaving two “current” answers.
